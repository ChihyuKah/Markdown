## Story time!
I was born in the Netherlands spent my childhood there until I was 9. Then I moved to Belgium
So I am already interacting with 2 countries. But the thing is I'm half Malaysian and half Singaporean.
So I consider myself multicultural.

###### TL;DR
I'm a Multicultural guy with 4 backgrounds.
